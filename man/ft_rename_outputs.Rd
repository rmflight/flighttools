\description{
When running a targets workflow, I often have files that are generated automatically
as part of the workflow. However, I often rename them to match the directory, and
add the day to the filename. This enables that automatically.
}
\details{
To rename actual targets, pass the output of \code{tar_read(target_name)}. Note that
this function will not copy and rename \code{qmd} and \code{rmd} source files.
